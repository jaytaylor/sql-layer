This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between Akiban Technologies, Inc., located at 560
Harrison Avenue, Suite 411, Boston, MA 02118 (“Akiban”) and the customer (individual or entity) that has
downloaded or otherwise procured the licensed Software (as defined below) for use as an end user (“you”).
This Agreement covers any Software and supporting technical documentation provided with the Software
(“Documentation”).

1. Definitions.

Effective Date: means the earlier of the date you sign an Order Form or the date on which the Software is
first made available to you.

Order Form: means any order on Akiban’s standard order form which is executed by Akiban and you and
which references this Agreement. Each Order Form which references this Agreement shall be deemed a
part of this Agreement. This Agreement is binding on you whether or not you executed an Order Form with
Akiban.

Software: means the Akiban software product(s) provided in connection with this Agreement in object
code form (or as otherwise specified in any related Order Form). “Software” shall also include any releases
provided to or purchased by you under any separate support and maintenance agreement you may enter into
with Akiban. Unless otherwise noted, the Software and Documentation are referred to collectively herein
as “Software”.

Subscription: means a subscription to use the Software and receive support and maintenance services.

Subscription Term: means the term of a Subscription designated in the applicable Order Form.

2. License.

2.1 Grant of License. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Subscription
Term, Akiban grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use the Software,
but only in accordance with (i) the Documentation, (ii) this Agreement and (iii) any term, server or other
restrictions set forth in the applicable Order Form or otherwise specified upon download. If you have not
executed a separate Order Form with Akiban and paid the applicable license fee for use of the Software,
then you are granted only a development-only license in accordance with Section 2.2 immediately below.

2.2 Development-only License. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you elect to download the Software
without executing a separate Order Form and paying the applicable license fee, you will be authorized to
access and use the Software solely for the purpose of testing, evaluation and internal product development

and solely at your designated evaluation or development site. Any other use of the Software is expressly
prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not make any production use of the Software. If
you pay the applicable license fee for the Software (and Akiban issues you a license key in exchange), you
will have the right to use the Software on the number of computers for which you have paid the applicable
license fee for the term of the license you have purchased, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

2.3 Installation and Copies. Akiban shall deliver the Software and Documentation by disk or other media or
make it available for download in electronic form. Akiban shall also provide you with electronic passwords
or other enabling mechanisms if necessary to permit the licensed usage of the Software. All subscriptions
shall commence, and delivery shall be deemed to occur, as of the Effective Date (or, if later, such date
on which the Software and license keys are first made available to you)., You may copy and install the
Software on a single computer for your own use. You may not allow any other individual to use the
Software. You may not make copies of the Software for any purpose.

2.4. License Restrictions. You shall not (and shall not allow any third party to): (a) decompile, disassemble,
or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code,
underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or programming interfaces of the Software by any means
whatsoever (except and only to the extent that applicable law prohibits or restricts reverse engineering
restrictions);(b) distribute, sell, sublicense, rent, lease or use the Software (or any portion thereof) for time
sharing, hosting, service provider or like purposes; (c) remove any product identification, proprietary,
copyright or other notices contained in the Software; or (d) modify any part of the Software, create a
derivative work of any part of the Software, or incorporate the Software into or with other software, except
to the extent expressly authorized in writing by Akiban.

2.5 Subscription Term. Unless otherwise designated in the Order Form, each Subscription Term is for a
twelve (12) month period only and shall automatically renew for subsequent periods of the same length at
the then-current price unless either party provides the other with notice of cancellation thirty (30) days or
more prior to expiration of the then-current term.

2.6 Special Note Regarding Akiban Open Source Projects. Akiban may elect to release certain software
under open source licenses (the “Akiban Open Source Licenses”) which may be the same as or similar
to components of the Software. Nothing in the Akiban Open Source Licenses grants any right to use the
Software and this Agreement alone shall govern any use of the Software.

3. Ownership.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except for the limited license rights expressly
provided herein, Akiban and its suppliers have and will retain all rights, title and interest (including,
without limitation, all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in
and to the Software and all copies, modifications and derivative works thereof (including any changes
which incorporate any of your ideas, feedback or suggestions). You acknowledge that you are obtaining
only a limited license right to the Software and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”
or like terms hereunder no ownership rights are being conveyed to you under this Agreement or otherwise.

4. Payment.

You shall pay all fees associated with the Software licensed and any services purchased hereunder as set
forth in the applicable Order Form. The rates for any Subscription Term renewals shall be Akiban’s then-
current Subscription rates. All payments shall be made in U.S. dollars within thirty (30) days of your
receipt of the applicable invoice, unless otherwise specified in writing by Akiban. Except as expressly set
forth herein, all fees are non-refundable once paid. You shall be responsible for all taxes, withholdings,
duties and levies arising from the order (excluding taxes based on the net income of Akiban). Any late
payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum
amount allowed by law, whichever is less.

5. Term of Agreement.

5.1 Term. This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and expires at such time as all license and
service subscriptions hereunder have expired in accordance with their own terms (the “Term”). Either
party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party: (a) fails to

cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach;
(b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust
deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted
against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days)). Termination is not an exclusive remedy and
the exercise by either party of any remedy under this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other
remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise.

5.2 Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, you shall cease any and all use of
any Software and destroy all copies thereof and so certify to Akiban in writing.

5.3 Survival. Sections 2.4 (License Restrictions), 3 (Ownership), 4 (Payment), 5 (Term of Agreement), 6.3
(Disclaimer of Warranties), 9 (Limitation of Remedies and Damages), 11 (Confidential Information), 13
(Export Compliance) and 14 (General) shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

6. Limited Warranty and Disclaimer.

6.1 Limited Warranty. Akiban warrants to you that for a period of ninety (90) days from the Effective Date
(the “Warranty Period”) the Software shall operate in substantial conformity with the Documentation.
Akiban does not warrant that your use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free or that any
security mechanisms implemented by the Software will not have inherent limitations. Akiban’s sole
liability (and your exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty shall be, in Akiban’s sole discretion,
to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with an error-correction or work-around which
corrects the reported non-conformity, or if Akiban determines such remedies to be impracticable within a
reasonable period of time, to refund the license fee paid for the Software. Akiban shall have no obligation
with respect to a warranty claim unless notified of such claim within the Warranty Period.

6.2 Exclusions. The above warranty shall not apply: (i) if the Software is used with hardware or software
not specified in the Documentation; (ii) if any modifications are made to the Software by you or any third
party; (iii) to defects in the Software due to accident, abuse or improper use by you; or (iv) to Software
provided on a no charge or evaluation basis.

6.3 Disclaimer of Warranties. THIS SECTION 6 IS A LIMITED WARRANTY AND, EXCEPT
AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6, THE SOFTWARE AND ALL SERVICES
ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”. NEITHER AKIBAN NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER
WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. YOU
MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE
LIMITED TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD.

7. Support & Maintenance.

Akiban shall provide the support and maintenance services, if any, as separately purchased by you and
specified in the applicable Order Form. All support & maintenance shall be provided pursuant to Akiban’s
standard service terms that are available upon request from Akiban.

8. Professional Services.

Akiban shall provide the number of person-days, if any, of professional consulting services (“Professional
Services”) purchased in the applicable Order Form and related Statement of Work. All Professional
Services shall be provided pursuant to Akiban’s standard service terms that are available upon request from
Akiban.

9. Limitation of Remedies and Damages.

9.1 NEITHER YOU NOR AKIBAN (INCLUDING AKIBAN’S SUPPLIERS) SHALL BE LIABLE FOR
ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF
BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER
IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE,

EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. THIS SECTION
9.1 SHALL NOT APPLY TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM ARISING UNDER THE
SECTIONS TITLED “GRANT OF LICENSE,” “LICENSE RESTRICTIONS” OR “CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION”.

9.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, AKIBAN AND ITS
SUPPLIERS’ ENTIRE LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED
THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO AKIBAN UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

9.3 The parties agree that the limitations specified in this Section 9 will survive and apply even if any
limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

10. Indemnification.

Akiban shall indemnify and hold you harmless from and against any claim of infringement of a U.S. patent,
U.S. copyright, or U.S. trademark asserted against you by a third party based upon your authorized use
of the Software, provided that Akiban shall have received from you: (i) prompt notice of such claim (but
in any event notice in sufficient time for Akiban to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to
control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary
cooperation. If your use of any of the Software is, or in Akiban’s opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the
type of infringement specified above, or if required by settlement, Akiban may, in its sole discretion: (a)
substitute for the Software substantially functionally similar programs and documentation; (b) procure for
you the right to continue using the Software; or if (a) and (b) are commercially impracticable, (c) terminate
the Agreement and refund the license fee paid by you as reduced to reflect a five (5) year straight-line
depreciation from the applicable license purchase date. The foregoing indemnification obligation of Akiban
shall not apply: (1) if the Software is modified by any party other than Akiban, but solely to the extent
the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (2) the Software is combined with other non-
Akiban products or process not authorized by Akiban, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is
caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of the Software; or (4) to any third-party code
contained within the Software. THIS SECTION 10 SETS FORTH AKIBAN’S SOLE LIABILITY AND
YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.

11. Confidential Information.

Any software, documentation or technical information provided by Akiban (or its agents) shall be
deemed “Akiban Confidential Information” without any marking or further designation. Except as
expressly authorized herein, you will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Akiban Confidential
Information. You acknowledge that disclosure of Akiban Confidential Information would cause substantial
harm to Akiban that could not be remedied by the payment of damages alone and therefore that upon any
such disclosure by you, Akiban shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever
remedies it might have at law.

12. Customer Acknowledgement.

You agree that Akiban may disclose you as a customer of Akiban.

13. Export Compliance.

You acknowledge that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the United States government and
import restrictions by certain foreign governments. You shall not, and shall not allow any third-party to,
remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or
any direct product thereof: (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting
country; (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury
Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (iii) to any country to which such export or re-export
is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an
export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such
license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations
of any United States or foreign agency or authority. You agree to the foregoing and warrant that you are
not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such

prohibited party list. The Software is further restricted from being used for the design or development of
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology, or for terrorist activity, without the prior
permission of the United States government.

14. General.

14.1 Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors
and assigns. Akiban may assign this Agreement to any affiliate or in connection with a merger,
reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of Akiban’s assets or voting securities.
You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without Akiban’s written consent. Any
attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement without such written consent will be null and void.

14.2 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary
so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in effect.

14.3 Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions
thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The
jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the Massachusetts state
and United States federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, and both parties hereby submit to the
personal jurisdiction of such courts.

14.4 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be
entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs in connection with such action.

14.5 Notices and Reports. Any notice or report hereunder shall be in writing. If to Akiban, such notice or

notice or report shall be sent to the address you provided upon placing your order. Notices and reports shall

waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will
any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party
claimed to have waived.

14.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual
understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and
communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No provision of any purchase order or in
any other business form employed by you will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
any such document issued by a party hereto relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes
only and shall have no legal effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have entered into a separate
written license agreement signed by Akiban for use of the Software, the terms and conditions of such other
agreement shall prevail over any conflicting terms or conditions in this Agreement.

14.8 Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no
relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the
parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf
without the other party’s prior written consent.

14.9 Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any
obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen
events, which occur after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control
of the parties, such as strikes, blockade, war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, refusal of license by the
government or other governmental agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays the affected
party from fulfilling its obligations and such party is not able to prevent or remove the force majeure at
reasonable cost.

14.10 Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If the user or licensee of the
Software is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication,
reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of
any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or by the terms of this
Agreement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed
fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited.

14.11 Third-Party Code. If designated in the Documentation, the Software may contain or be provided
with certain third-party code (including code which may be made available to you in source code form).
Ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to any such designated code shall be as
