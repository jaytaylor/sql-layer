# Mapping of known collation names to internal "scheme" values.
# A scheme consists of a permanent ID value, a locale name and an optional
# ICU4J collator strength. Strength value 1 means case-independent, strength 
# 2 and above are case-sensitive and sensitive to other differences such as
# accents, etc.
#
# The permanent ID is written into the encoded sort key data in the database
# and therefore must not change after databases are populated.  Currently
# Akiban Server can support up to 127 unique collation IDs from 0 through 126
# and ID 0 is reserved for BINARY collation. If a scheme such as "nn:sv_SE,1"
# occurs more than once in this file, then every instance must use the same
# ID value.
#
# Scheme names starting with "mysql_" specify an alternative collator
# implementing using weight tables included in as properties below.
# To produce a sort key the MySQL collator simply substitutes a weight
# from the weight table for each character of the original string.
# This mechanism is supported only for the latin1 character set.
#
# A special non-locale name "UCS_BINARY" implies that the collation should 
# be based on the binary encoding of the string. Several name variations used
# in Akiban Server tests are provided here.
#
# The intent of this file is to include both the relevant MySQL collation 
# name and a more general local name.  The general format is xx-uu where
# xx is a language code (ISO-639) such as "es" (Spanish), "en" (English)
# etc. and yy is a control code (ISO-3166) such as "us" (USA) or "gb"
# Great Britain. In this properties file all property names must be spelled
# in lower case, and the match on name is case-insensitive.
#
# Only those collation schemes that have been tested for at least
# plausible correctness should be included in this file.
#
# Properties starting with "mysql_" contain weight tables for MySQL-compatible
# latin1 collations.
#
# MySQL collations specify the character set, locale and case-insensitivity.
# In Akiban Server, the character set is handled separately since all strings
# are internally stored and managed in Unicode form.
