#
# The following is intended to be temporary.  As of Persistit 3.2.0 the default
# format of the IV (Identify Volume) journal record has changed.  The change is
# forward-, but not backward-compatible, meaning that journal files created
# post-3.2.0 are not readable by earlier versions.  As a consequence, a site would
# be unable to revert Akiban Server to an earlier version in the event of a problem.
# 
# This property causes Persistit 3.2.0 and above to write old-style volume
# identifiers so that journal files are backward-compatible.  The intention is
# to enable this property for two Akiban Server release cycles so that at least one
# updrade will be capable of being reverted in the event of a problem.  Once no
# sites exist which are subject to possibly reverting to a version of Akiban Server
# containing Persisit 3.1.7 or before, then this property should should be removed.
